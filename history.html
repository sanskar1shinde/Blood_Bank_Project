        <h4 style="color:rgb(11, 12, 11);font-size: 20px;">
         While the first blood transfusions were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation,it was discovered<br>
         that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it for some days,<br>
         thus opening the way for the development of blood banks.<br> 
         John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at<br> 
         St Mary's Hospital, London, in the late 19th century.His attempts, using phosphate of soda, <br>
         however, were unsuccessful.[citation needed]<br>
        The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914, by the Belgian doctor Albert Hustin,<br>
        though this was a diluted solution of blood.The Argentine doctor Luis Agote used a much less diluted<br>
        solution in November of the same year. Both used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant.

        <br> The Foundation stone of the hospital was laid in September 1982 by Late Shri. Dongreji Maharaj. His auspicious presence<br>
         and blessings were the motivation for this undertaking of service to society. Poona Hospital & Research Centre was established <br>
         in 1985 under the aegis of the Rajasthani & Gujarati Charitable Foundation, with the aim of providing quality medical care <br>
         at a reasonable cost to the public.The hospital which was established entirely through donations from local citizens<br>
         presently has 250 beds with state-of-the-art medical facilities.In addition to providing quality health care the focus<br>
         is also on preventive health programmes, medical education and clinical research.
