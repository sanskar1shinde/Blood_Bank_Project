<h4>Our goal is to provide information about what complications can occur due to<br> 
    ENPP1 and ABCC6 Deficiencies (e.g. GACI, ARHR2) and to provide hope for families<br>
    impacted by the condition. We hope that our website,newsletter, and social <br> 
     media outlets act as a resource not only for medical information but for personal<br>
     support during your own GACI/ARHR2 journey. Our community is small but growing and <br>
     we hope to offer support and information to families affected by this disorder around the world.
